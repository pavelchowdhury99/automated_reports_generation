        <p>Ahmedabad, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar on Sunday said talking about the Indian Ocean and not the Pacific Ocean when discussing India's maritime interest shows a limitation of thinking, and India should go beyond this historical line of thinking.
"So far, we think about the Indian Ocean whenever we think about oceans.
This is the limitation of our thinking that we talk about the Indian Ocean whenever we talk about maritime interest," Jaishankar said.
"But more than 50 per cent of our trade goes towards the East, towards the Pacific Ocean.
If we do not talk about ourselves, then how will the world talk about us. abc abc abd </p>

        <p>Although Singh was on a personal visit to India this time, Kaur said, Indian authorities suspected that he would do some professional work while in the country.
But, I think, the Indian authorities thought that he would do some journalism-related work this time ...
There should be no other reason to deny the entry,” Kaur told VOA.
This time his trip was purely personal, with no connection with any documentary at all,” Kaur told VOA.
“We cannot make out why the Indian authorities have been vindictive on him while he was on a personal visit to his motherland. abc abc abd </p>

        <p>PM Modi chose the name Asha, which means hope,” said Susan Yannetti, coordinator, Cheetah Conservation Fund (CCF).
Travelling over 8,000km from Namibia, the big cats entered their 15x30 metre enclosure at Kuno at around 11am on Saturday.
Two cheetahs are taking time to adjust but they are healthy,” Wildlife Institute of India dean YV Jhala said.
“A medical check-up was done and all the cheetahs are healthy, and adapting to the new home very well,” said Laurie Marker, executive director of Cheetah Conservation Fund.
The female cheetahs were named Siyaya, Tblisi, Sasha and Savanaha, by CCF, while the third male cheetah was named Oban. abc abc abd </p>

        <p>But before the big event and a massive assignment for Rohit, former Australia cricketer Mitchell Johnson has snubbed the star batter to make a huge India captaincy statement.
His comment came in reference to Kohli ending his 1021-days long century drought in international cricket with a sensational 122* against Afghanistan in Asia Cup.
Johnson also talked about India's chances in the World Cup in Australia next month after their failure to reach the Asia Cup final after back-to-back losses in the Super 4 stage.
“When it comes to World Cup, you just enjoy the moment.
I think all that stuff (Asia Cup performance) will be behind them,” he added. abc abc abd </p>

        <p>Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal and his Assam counterpart Himanta Biswa Sarma have been engaging in a fierce Twitter spat that continued to rage on with the latest jibe by the AAP chief coming today.
“There is a saying we have — If someone asks ‘When should I come’ and they say ‘Come whenever you can’, then it means ‘Don’t come ever’.
Tell me, when should I come, only then I can come,” Kejriwal tweeted in a reply to Himanta Biswa Sarma after the Assam CM shared a post mocking Kejriwal, highlighting some differences between Delhi and Assam.
Kejriwal had tweeted a ‘peace’ message calling for unity extending an invite to the Assam CM.
You come to Delhi, I will show you the work in Delhi,” Kejriwal had said. abc abc abd </p>
